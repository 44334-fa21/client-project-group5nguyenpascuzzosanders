        At Waubonsie, the safety of our clients and staff is our highest priority. To mitigate the risk of a Covid infection occurring at one of our sites, we've implemented increased cleaning/hygiene measures throughout our facilities and have vastly expanded our telehealth offerings to offer services to clients from the comfort and safety of their own homes. Additionally, all staff, clients, and others entering one of our facilities may choose to wear a mask if that is their preference. Individuals exhibiting signs of illness at the time of their appointment will be provided with the option to receive services via telehealth from their homes.</p><br>
